      <h2>1. Right of Withdrawal</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Right of Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you, acquires physical possession of the goods.</p>
      <h3>1.2 Exercising the Right of Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us, [Your Company Name and Address], through a clear statement (e.g., by mail or email), about your decision to withdraw from this contract.</p>
      <h3>1.3 Withdrawal Form (optional)</h3>
      <p>You may use the attached withdrawal form (Annex 1), but it is not mandatory. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

      <h2>2. Effects of Withdrawal</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Return of Goods</h3>
      <p>If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and, in any event, not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract.</p>
      <h3>2.2 Refund Method</h3>
      <p>We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
      <h3>2.3 Return Shipping Costs</h3>
      <p>You will have to bear the direct cost of returning the goods.</p>
      <h3>2.4 Deduction for Diminished Value</h3>
      <p>We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you.</p>

      <h2>3. Exceptions to the Right of Withdrawal</h2>
      <p>Please note that the right of withdrawal may not apply to certain types of goods, such as sealed goods that are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</p>
